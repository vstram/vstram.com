    My name is Vinicius Strugata Ambrosio, I have a degree in Mechanical Production Engineering (UFSC),
    with a postgraduate degree in Industrial Engineering 4.0 (UFPR). I'm certified in Lean Six Sigma Black-Belt
    by the Inomm Institute.

    The purpose of this site is to share with you some of my main interests and personal projects. 
    It will also end up serving as a repository of knowledge (even for myself), registering
    what I've been working with over time.

    The topics covered will be related to the Engineering and Technology area, but I will also try to write about
    travel, music, cinema and series.
    I hope it's interesting!
