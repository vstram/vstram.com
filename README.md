This is a sample Nikola blog, compatible with Netlify CMS.

Hit this one button:

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/getnikola/nikola-netlify-cms&stack=cms)

You will then receive an e-mail, asking you to register at your new site. Consider changing your site name in the General settings, and site URL in `files/admin/config.yml`. You should end up with a site with the Netlify CMS available in `/admin/`. Congratulations!

*PS.* Netlify CMS can be used without Netlifyâ€™s CDN/hosting service, but that requires some extra configuration work. Also, *preview images* require theme support. For bootblog4, if your posts have the status of `featured`, they will be used on the index page as a background of the featured post.
